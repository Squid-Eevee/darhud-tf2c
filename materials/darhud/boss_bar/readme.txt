depending on how much you like to poke around/modify your hud installation you might have noticed these boss_bar_surround files in previous versions
this readme file is just here for me to acknowledge and address them
these files aren't for anything in tf2c at the moment, but if they ever finish overpowered it'll surely have a bossbar of some kind
if not then idk i hope there'll be a use for them in the future somehow
btw if you don't know what overpowered is, refer to this page: https://wiki.tf2classic.com/wiki/Overpowered
